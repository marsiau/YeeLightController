(I'm new to Python 3 and have never done Python 2. I could quite possibly be very wrong.)

in function bulbs_detection_loop()[1] passive listener loop is never executed as well as time_elapsed is never incremented due to thread being stuck in the scanner loop

def bulbs_detection_loop():
  '''
  a standalone thread broadcasting search request and listening on all responses
  '''
  debug("bulbs_detection_loop running")
  search_interval=30000
  read_interval=100
  time_elapsed=0

  while RUNNING:
    if time_elapsed%search_interval == 0:
      send_search_broadcast()

    # scanner
